# ArcGIS AppStudio Tutorial

Taking a basic side by side map and adding a feature service to one of the maps

## Getting Started

Begin by downloading and installing the AppStudio for ArcGIS desktop. [ArcGIS.com](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/appstudio/create-apps/guidedtour.htm#GUID-C3A0CE70-2E92-40CB-8124-1BE599853C96)


### Let's Being

-Open Esri App Studio
-In Esri App Studio, select “New App” and the following pop up window will appear.
-Select starter and choose “Hello World (Runtime)
-Give the App an applicable name (pun intended :))

-When you double click the file that was generated by the steps completed above, it will launch a hello world map application that has a title bar and some map navigation tools.
-Next click "Edit" 
-To edit this app, we need to open the file in Qt Creator. 
-Select the file in Esri App Studio and click on the Qt icon at the top and the QML file will open in Qt. You will see the default Qml file is called MyApp.qml
-Next, we are going to copy and paste the map code into its own file so things don’t get to messy in one file. 
-To do this, Click File -> New File then project -> select Qt and then select QML File (QT Quick 2) and click “choose” and name it “MyMap” and leave the rest default. 
-This will put the file in the app you just created. 
-You've created the new file called “MyMap.qml” and in this new file, delete everything including the following: 


```
import QtQuick 2.0//
Item {
} 
```

And replace with your map code

 
You should then paste in the following code to create the second map:
```
import QtQuick 2.3
import QtQuick.Controls 1.2
import QtQuick.Layouts 1.1
import QtPositioning 5.3

import ArcGIS.AppFramework 1.0
import ArcGIS.AppFramework.Controls 1.0
import ArcGIS.AppFramework.Runtime 1.0
import ArcGIS.AppFramework.Runtime.Controls 1.0

Map {
    id: map

    anchors {
        left: parent.left
        right: parent.right
        top: titleRect.bottom
        bottom: parent.bottom
    }


}

```

you will end up with side-by-side maps that look like this when visualized in the app:

-Next under either of your MyApp or MyMap qml files place the following code:
```
        Map {
            BasemapTerrainWithLabels {}
            initialViewpoint: vc

            FeatureLayer {
                ServiceFeatureTable {
                    url: "http://this_will_be_the_url_to_your_own_feature_rest_service"
                }
            }
        }

        ViewpointCenter {
            id: vc
            center: Point {
                x: -13176752
                y: 4090404
                spatialReference: SpatialReference {
                    wkid: 102100
                }
            }
            targetScale: 300000
        }
    }
}
```

Thanks to ESRI and its turn-key abilites you now have a functioning app that serves a purpose!
